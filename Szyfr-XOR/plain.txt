 and so on   safe water is a human right clean drinking water is
 fundamental but it is also vital for sanitation and hygiene it 
is estimated that more than  children under the age of seven die

tion the right to water and sanitation was recognised as a human
 right by the un general assembly in  however there are still at
 least  billion people around the world who live without safe wa
ter in their homes these include rural communities people who ha
ve been displaced due to war and local conflicts and areas where
 climate change is making water more and more scarce  the proble
ms facing communities without water apart from the obvious healt
h issues a lack of accessible clean water means that people  oft
en women and children  spend hours every day walking to and from
 distant water supplies this means they dont have time to dedica
te to work studies and other domestic duties the search for wate
r becomes their main occupation and people who are not able to w
alk to get their own water are particularly vulnerable    for ma
ny people access to water has become increasingly difficult due 
to increased demand for a finite resource according to figures r
eleased by the un around  billion people  nearly twothirds of th
e worlds population  experience severe water scarcity during at 
least one month of the year it is believed that by  as many as  
million people worldwide could be displaced by intense water sca
rcity  what are the solutions there are many charities working o
n creating sustainable supplies of clean water at a grassroots l
evel for different communities around the world and this importa
nt work needs to continue and to expand but the fundamental prob
lem of increasing demand for a limited resource can only be addr
essed by more efficient use of water especially in industry and 
agriculture wastewater recycling capturing rainwater more effici
ent irrigation techniques and reforestation are all examples of 
how water can be used more efficiently  what we can do to help a
s individuals what we can do to help is support charities raise
